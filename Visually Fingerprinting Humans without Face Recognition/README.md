## Abstract

The main idea of the paper is to create a system that will allow us to create a temporary "fingerprint" of ourselves that can sever as an alternative of face recognition. The authors claim that they have achieve consistent results by using the color of a persons dress and their style.

The authors argue that it may not always be possible to scan for faces in a event, so they propose anonther alternate for this by creating sort of a "temporary fingerprint" which will be based on human motion pattern and clothing colors. 

Here are few of the applications that the authors suggested are in VR and privacy. One can identify a person in an event if his/her temporary fingerprint is registered using their camera enabled glass (like [Google Glass](https://www.google.com/glass/start/) ). It can also be used in privacy preserving application, like if a stranger's video happen to include the user's footage, they can just say keyword like <i>remove me</i> and the system should hypothetically remove all her fingerprint from that footage.
